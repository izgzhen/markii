#### State transition rules for MediaRecorder API ####

# Class of tracked object
baseClassName: "android.media.MediaRecorder"

# Enumerations of possible abstract states
states: ["STOPPED", "STARTED"]

# Initial state when the object is constructed
initialState: "STOPPED"

# State transition rules as a map
# - key represents the method of which the invocation is tracked
# - value represents the target state of transition.
#
# For example, "<android.media.MediaRecorder: void start()>": "STARTED" means that, if the abstract state of
# MediaRecorder object "x" is STARTED or STOPPED, then after the statement "x.start();", its abstract state
# will become STARTED.
# 
# Note that there is no constraint over the source state, thus left unspecified.
transferMap:
  "<android.media.MediaRecorder: void start()>": "STARTED"
  "<android.media.MediaRecorder: void stop()>": "STOPPED"
